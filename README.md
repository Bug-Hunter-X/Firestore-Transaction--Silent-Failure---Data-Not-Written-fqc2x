This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue encountered with Firebase Firestore transactions.  Despite successful commit confirmations, data updates are not reflected in the database. The provided JavaScript code illustrates the problem and a proposed solution.  The `firestoreBug.js` file shows the flawed transaction implementation, while `firestoreBugSolution.js` presents a corrected version.  The key appears to be more rigorous error handling and potentially checking the transaction result more thoroughly.
